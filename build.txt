npx expo prebuild

cd android

./gradlew assembleDebug


2. For Release APK
It’s a bit more complex because you need to sign it, but it’s still doable with just the command line:

Generate a keystore using keytool (comes with JDK)

Add signing config in android/app/build.gradle

Run:

./gradlew assembleRelease

The unsigned APK will be in the release folder; if you configured signing, it will be signed.
